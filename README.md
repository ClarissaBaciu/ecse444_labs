# ecse444_labs - microprocessors 

### Labs dealing with various uses of the STM32L4S5 Microprocessor.

#### lab 1
Creation of 3 different implementations of the Kalman Filter function using Embedded C, Assembly and the CMSIS library. Performance was compared using the SWV tracer. 

#### lab 2
A script to get familiar with GPIOs by toggling and LED at the touch of a button. 

#### lab 3
Creation of a script to play sounds on a speaker using a sawtooth wave, a triangle wave and a sine waves at audible frequencie ranges: 1kHz, 1.5 kHz and 2 kHz. The signals were created using the CMSIS DSP library and passed through the DAC using timer interrupts. They were then generated using the DMA. Finally a push button was configured to enable interrupts and switch between different frequency sine waves thereby playing different notes.
